<p>I am Leigh Keane, and I live in Thirroul, a beachside village in the northern suburbs of Wollongong.</p>
<p>I was born in and lived in Tasmania and after failing to complete an Arts degree, I moved to New South Wales in the mid 1990’s.</p>
<p>After getting married to my wife Kym in 2009, we  moved back to Tasmania for almost 5 years – I had to get it out of my system before returning to Sydney.</p>
<p>We have two young daughters (Stella 7 and Georgina 4) who keep us pretty busy. .</p>
<p>I work in Sales for Teletrac Navman, the leader in vehicle “telematics” in the ANZ region. Vehicle telematics encompasses the capture of data from GPS tracking and vehicle movement as well as other inputs into the system using different hardware sensors – driver identification, harsh driving, temperature, vehicle canbus data etc. I like this industry as the integration of technologies is growing, and it also offers great insights into how vehicles are being used to lots of different parties. .</p>
<p>Our office (when I have to go) is in Macquarie Park which is a bit of a hike, so even outside of Covid I work from home quite a bit. .</p>
<p>When I do get spare time I like to keep fit, work in our garden, brew beer, play my guitar and I also read a lot.  .</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>While I did have a computer when I was young, I think that my real interest in IT has largely been driven by my changing employment. .</p>
<p>In my early career I worked in production coordination roles in the print and mail industry where I would be the interface between the customer, IT, and the production floor. My role was very much instructional – taking the client brief and splitting it up for the different internal departments, then following everything through to completion. .</p>
<p>I then moved into project management which in truth was kind of more of the same, but with the onboarding of new customers. Later, after a 4 year stint as an account manager, I changed tack and managed a document scanning bureau in Hobart for nearly 5 years. We managed to win Best ICT Service at the Tas ICT Awards in both 2012 and 2013 which was amazing for our small business. .</p>

<p>There was a little bit of industry overlap in this role, but I got to be more hands on – working with print files and paper, as well as a range of software products to manipulate and index images. I really enjoyed the hands-on nature of that role, but I was lured back to Sydney and worked in a true project management role for Fuiji Xerox Document Management Services. .</p>
<p>It was here that I was exposed to a higher level of professional IT working environment. We had a Project Management Office to oversee and maintain standards. As well as a couple of customer IT projects, I took on some internal projects that were a great experience. It took me a few years to get over leaving that job and wondering whether I had made the right decision for the long-term. .</p>
<p>In 2015 I was talked into a relationship management role in a totally new industry to me with Teletrac Navman. .</p>
<p>I see that in my career it has generally been my role to get IT professionals – programmers, developers, DBA’s, and architects etc - to fulfil key customer and project tasks. However, at the same time I have always been more hands-on with software than my colleagues in the same roles.  .</p>
<p>While I currently work in Sales, I still find myself taking calls to customers to assist and do so happily rather than flicking them on to our support team. .</p>
<p>At the same time, I am aware of the gulf in my broader technical knowledge, and I would like to overcome this in order to both understand the back end product better, and to be able to communicate better with IT professionals. .</p>
<p>I am eager to learn some programming and have recently bought a Raspberry Pi. Ultimately I am keen to embrace this course and the complexities that I will be exposed to. .</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
IT Project Manager
 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50531995?type=standout#searchRequestToken=25d23670-fabf-45ce-9be0-4e2717cf0292">Here is a link to the advertisement</a>

<p>This sounds like a great role, project planning and and seeing through delivery to the customer in an  IT intensive environment. This role appeals to me me given that I do have project management experience, and the technology isn’t too far removed from what I have worked on in the past. Because of the focus on cloud, and my time away from project management, I am attracted to some of the challenges.</p>
<p>In terms of qualifcations the ad clearly states that the PM must have Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) experience as well as certification in IT  and Prince 2 (project management methology).
MSP and Prince 2 are qualifications that I would need to gain, though these are standard industry courses offered widely. </p>
<p>Demonstrated knowledge of other tools and platforms including AWS and ConnectWise is also listed. I figure that I would have the opportunity for exposure to these through my RMIT study.
In terms of the other skills and experience required, I believe that I can meet those requirements having experience mentoring and managing teams previously, and I have a Diploma of Management.
The opportunity for customer engagement is a real positive to me in this role. With my background in relationship management and sales, I think that I am covered, but it is the specific IT and project management qualifications that I would need to focus on. 
For where I see a shortfall in my skills and experience, I would be prepared to undertake the relevant courses to bridge any gap.</p>


<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>As part of this assignment, I undertook the:
Myers-Briggs test - <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16Personalities
Learning Styles test  - <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">Learning Styles
Big Five Personality Test  - <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">Big Five

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Myers Briggs – this test labelled me as a “Campaigner” which describes a true free spirit – life of the party but enjoying the social and emotional connections at the party rather than the noise and excitement of the party itself. The Campaigner is portrayed as a good listener with genuine empathy and big ideas, yet not necessarily great at following through. Perhaps more of an idealist than a pragmatist.</p>

<p>On the scales below, there are no truly polarizing scores, however there is a tendency to feelings and empathy. </p>
 <img src="Quiz1.png" width="104" height="142">

<p>Aside from being the life of the party there is much that I can relate to in the description, though that I while I might be a bit of a daydreamer, I’m no longer such an idealist, and with age has come more of a practical approach to life.</p> 
In terms of what I need to be mindful of for group work, it suggests that I need to make an effort to focus and not overthink or get stressed.</p>
One of my traits is to be observant and take things in but in a team environment I need to ensure that I am heard rather than sit back and let the team steer us in a way that I don’t buy into.</p>

<h3>The Learning styles test</h3>
<p>This test suggested matched me most highly with the Reflector style, then with the Pragmatist style someway back.</p>
<p>My feeling is that this is accurate. While I usually catch on quickly, I do like to take time to synthesize ideas. I do also work well in small groups rather than large ones. More intimate groups and coaching work with me, and I am open to self examination and feedback from others. I find if there is a leadership void I will generally step in, however when surrounded by strong personalities I can let things roll on.</p>
<p>In a group assignment situation this will hopefully help me get along with others, but it may mean that I work a bit slower and over-think.</p>

<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
<p>Assuming that I have understood the results I also think that there is some relevance in this test to me.</p>
<p>I am certainly not an extrovert, but higher along the spectrum to extroversion than introversion. I see myself as emotionally stable, agreeable and conscientious but do hold a little in reserve at times. </p>
<p>I would never label myself as creative or imaginative as strong traits either, though I am not lacking in these.</p>
<p>I guess the results point to me being largely pleasant and normal (I tried the Dark Triad Traits test and no concerns there), so I don’t think that the results here point to any specific concerns with the group work tasks. </p>
<p>In all I think the testing has made me reflective of myself, how I learn and operate best, but also what I need to be mindful of when collaborating in a group, particularly with regard to making an effort to be heard, staying focused and not overthinking. </p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to indicate whether a rainwater tank has water in it or not, and if so, how much.</p>
<p>Given recent droughts, rainwater tanks have become more prevalent and in some areas are mandated by councils on new buildings. Generally, there is no indicator on the tank as to the water level, so a user doesn’t know whether the water that they are using is coming from the tank or the mains. Given that mains water comes at a cost, the presence or absence of water in a tank may inform the water use decisions of the householder.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I have a rainwater tank that I use to water the garden, but I have no idea as to the status of the water in the tank. The tank is used to water the garden but when empty the pump switches over to mains supply so I may be using mains water inadvertently. The water tank is down the side of the house and accessing it is difficult. Currently the only way know whether there is water in the tank is to bang on the side of the tank which is not particularly accurate, or get up on a ladder to look inside.</p> 

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The level of water within the tank can be captured using an ultrasonic distance sensor mounted to the inside roof of the tank. This would be connected to the Raspberry Pi via usb.</p>
<p>A configured LED would in turn be plugged into the Raspberry Pi via usb and all hardware housed in a waterproof box.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Ultrasonic distance sensor - <a href="https://core-electronics.com.au/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-module-distance-measuring-sensor.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CjwKCAjw4_H6BRALEiwAvgfzq_Rv0R-ilGBgTW-3oXw-E5KblqSY9ArLJXB15fbyXf-VWlCfEqtMAxoCNbIQAvD_BwE</li>" such as this</a>
<li>LED’s</li>
<li>Waterproof housing for hardware</li>
<li>Python code</li>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>An understanding of how the Raspberry Pi works will be necessary along with the programming skills to write the code. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The outcome for this project would be a basic visual indicating system to show the water level within the tank. Using for example a 10 LED output, 5 illuminated LED’s would indicate that the tank is half full and these could be coloured green and red with red being empty.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, the user will be aware of the water level within the tank and be able to use their water in a more informed way. There would also be an opportunity to expand the functionality and integrate with an automated irrigation system.</p>
